"""What the periodic mutation run covers, and how it reports.

Run: uv run --group mutation python tests/mutation_scope.py --patterns
     uv run --group mutation python tests/mutation_scope.py --report

Mutation testing asks what coverage cannot: not "did a test execute this line" but "would
a test have *noticed* if this line were wrong".

It is scoped, and not run on pull requests. `src/` carries ~3600 mutants; a full pass is
tens of minutes and most of it is noise — a mutated log string is not a defect anyone will
ship. What earns the machine time is code where being wrong is silent:

  ttl            An off-by-one in an idle threshold does not fail. It keeps data a week too
                 long or deletes it a day too early, and nobody finds out from a stack
                 trace. The whole retention promise is four comparisons.
  authorization  Every gate fails closed by design; a mutant that flips one to fail-open is
                 invisible on the happy path. A signed lane that verifies nothing still
                 returns 200.
  caps           The only thing between an anonymous, world-writable service and its disk.
                 A cap with the wrong operator holds right up to the moment it matters.
  guidance       The refusal bodies are the real documentation for an agent that already
                 got something wrong. A test asserting only the status code lets them rot.

Patterns are mutmut mutant names: `<module>.x_<function>__mutmut_<n>`, where a private
`_reap` becomes `x__reap`. Grouped by theme rather than module — `caps` spans three files,
and "is the rate limiter covered" should not require knowing which one.
